# 🧠 Interactive Hopfield Network Visualization

## 🎯 My Learning Journey

I created this project with the assistance of ChatGPT and Claude (Anthropic), and I'm amazed by how it turned out! While I'm still wrapping my head around some of the advanced concepts, I wanted to share my learning journey with others who might be in a similar position.

> **Personal Note**: Being completely honest, while I understand the basics well now, I'm still exploring and learning the advanced concepts. I believe this makes the project more relatable for others who are also on their learning journey!

## 📚 Learning Progression

### Basic vs Advanced Concepts

| Aspect | Basic Version | Advanced Version |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Complexity** | 2 neurons | 5x5 grid (25 neurons) |
| **Visualization** | Energy landscape | Pattern recognition & recovery |
| **Concepts** | Simple state changes | Pattern storage & noise handling |
| **Understanding Level** | ✅ Clear understanding | 🔄 Still exploring |
| **Best For** | Beginners | Intermediate/Advanced |

### Detailed Content Breakdown

#### 🌱 Basic Version (Getting Started)
| Feature | Description | Difficulty |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Two Neurons | Simple network with just two connected neurons | ⭐ |
| Energy Visualization | Shows how "comfortable" the network is | ⭐⭐ |
| State Changes | Demonstrates how neurons influence each other | ⭐⭐ |
| Basic Plotting | Simple color-coded visualization | ⭐ |

#### 🚀 Advanced Version (Deep Dive)
| Feature | Description | Difficulty |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Pattern Recognition | Stores and recalls letter patterns | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Noise Handling | Recovers patterns from noisy input | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Animation | Shows network evolution over time | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Multiple Patterns | Stores multiple patterns simultaneously | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## 🤖 AI Assistance Recognition

This project was developed with the help of:
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: Helped with initial code structure and explanations
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Assisted with code improvements and educational content

I believe in being transparent about AI usage while learning - it's a powerful tool that helped me understand these concepts better!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Choose your starting point:

### For Beginners (Like I Was!)
1. Start with the basic two-neuron network
2. Experiment with energy landscapes
3. Understand simple state changes

### For Advanced Users
1. Explore pattern recognition
2. Play with noise reduction
3. Create custom patterns

## 📊 Code Examples

### Basic Example (I understand this well!)
```python
# Simple two-neuron network
def create_energy_landscape():
    weights = np.array([[0, 1], 
                       [1, 0]])
    # ... visualization code
```

### Advanced Example (Still exploring this!)
```python
# Pattern recognition network
class AdvancedHopfieldNetwork:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.weights = np.zeros((size, size))
    # ... advanced functionality
```
